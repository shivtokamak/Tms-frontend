### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Getting your local development environment up and running is a breeze. Simply follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Viewing Your Application

After starting the development server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your application in action. You'll notice that any changes you make to `pages/index.tsx` are reflected in real-time, thanks to the hot reloading feature.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
